{"posts":[{"title":"GSoC 2025 Zarr: Bit Packing Compression","text":"This Google Summer of Code project aims to integrate an optimized bit-packing compression method into Zarr for data like 10-bit or 12-bit SCA data. By concentrating on a specialized compressor, one that can match or exceed the performance of uncompressed data and LZ4 within HDF, the project will advance both the practicality and scalability of large-scale SCA. In addition, leveraging parallelization strategies can further improve throughput, demonstrating how bit-packing can serve as a cornerstone of high performance data management for SCA and beyond. Bit-packing is a powerful compression technique that reduces storage and I/O overhead by tightly grouping data into the minimal number of bits needed for each sample. Unlike more generic compression algorithms, bit-packing is designed specifically for numeric data with known bit-depth—such as 10-bit or 12-bit raw signals—thus ensuring minimal wasted space and faster read/write operations. When applied to large datasets, bit-packing can dramatically decrease file sizes, mitigate I/O bottlenecks, and accelerate downstream analysis. Recent tools and libraries, including NVIDIA’s nvCOMP, demonstrate how parallelization can further enhance performance by exploiting modern hardware capabilities such as multi-core CPUs and GPUs. This parallel approach enables high-throughput encoding and decoding of compressed data, making bit-packing an ideal solution for scenarios where quick access to large, high-resolution measurements is critical. Although bit-packing is applicable to a wide range of data-intensive fields, it is especially valuable in Side Channel Analysis (SCA), where massive volumes of power consumption measurements at 10-bit or 12-bit resolutions can be generated. Large-scale SCA—often used to uncover vulnerabilities in cryptographic implementations—requires extensive data collection and rapid analysis. By combining specialized bit-packing techniques with the Zarr file format, researchers can compress enormous datasets without sacrificing precision, thus speeding up algorithms like Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Correlation Power Analysis (CPA). The SCARR framework [1] highlights modern design patterns for efficient data handling, leveraging Zarr for its chunked layout and random-access capabilities. Zarr’s on-the-fly compression and flexible storage structure pair well with bit-packing, enabling targeted optimizations for high-bit-depth ADC samples. This synergy significantly cuts down on the disk space needed to store SCA traces while boosting read/write throughput—ultimately reducing the time researchers spend on I/O and letting them focus on analysis. This Google Summer of Code project aims to integrate an optimized bit-packing compression method into Zarr for data like 10-bit or 12-bit SCA data. By concentrating on a specialized compressor, one that can match or exceed the performance of uncompressed data and LZ4 within HDF, the project will advance both the practicality and scalability of large-scale SCA.

Github: Laika404/ComputationalProject This project tried to investigate how effectively a centralised takeover strategy can mitigate traffic congestion in simulated highway based on agent-based model. This was done through the reproduction of an already existent agent-based model based on a paper by [1]. The model was expanded upon by adding agent behaviour for multiple lanes and logic that simulates a central controller. It was hypothesized that centralized vehicle takeover will be significantly more effective than human-based models in mitigating congestion. This was confirmed as the central vehicle takeover managed to increase the average speed of the vehicles and maintain a higher flow under congested conditions.

Our platform allows teachers to easily manage assignments and facilitates a robust peer review process among students, supported by advanced AI technologies. Github: Janourid/PSE Our project is a web application that empowers teachers to elevate the quality of education they provide. Teachers can effortlessly submit assignments for their courses, and students can conveniently submit their work through the platform. Once a student submits their assignment, it is then assigned to another student for review. This peer review process is central to our platform, fostering a collaborative learning environment. What sets our product apart is our commitment to enhancing the quality of peer reviews. Before a reviewer receives an assignment, it is processed through a Large Language Model (LLM). This advanced AI technology thoroughly examines the submitted code, identifying areas for potential improvement. It then provides the reviewer with insightful hints and guidance on what to look for during their review. This not only helps reviewers provide more constructive feedback but also aids in their own learning and understanding of the subject matter. By leveraging cutting-edge AI, Pear-to-Peer not only streamlines assignment management but also enriches the educational experience by ensuring that peer reviews are thorough, insightful, and beneficial for all students involved. Our goal is to create a supportive educational ecosystem where both teachers and students can thrive. This project is based on the course Project Software Engineering of UvA.

Features For Teachers Assignment Management: Teachers can easily create, manage, and assign coursework to students. Submission Tracking: Monitor student submissions and track the review process efficiently. For Students Submission Portal: Students can submit their assignments through an intuitive interface. Peer Reviews: After submission, assignments are randomly assigned to other students for review. AI-Powered Review AssistanceWhat sets Pear-to-Peer apart is our integration of a Large Language Model (LLM) to assist in the peer review process: Automated Code Analysis: Before a student reviewer receives an assignment, our LLM analyzes the submitted code to identify potential areas of improvement.
