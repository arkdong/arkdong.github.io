Github: Laika404/ComputationalProject This project tried to investigate how effectively a centralised takeover strategy can mitigate traffic congestion in simulated highway based on agent-based model. This was done through the reproduction of an already existent agent-based model based on a paper by [1]. The model was expanded upon by adding agent behaviour for multiple lanes and logic that simulates a central controller. It was hypothesized that centralized vehicle takeover will be significantly more effective than human-based models in mitigating congestion. This was confirmed as the central vehicle takeover managed to increase the average speed of the vehicles and maintain a higher flow under congested conditions.

Our platform allows teachers to easily manage assignments and facilitates a robust peer review process among students, supported by advanced AI technologies. Github: Janourid/PSE Our project is a web application that empowers teachers to elevate the quality of education they provide. Teachers can effortlessly submit assignments for their courses, and students can conveniently submit their work through the platform. Once a student submits their assignment, it is then assigned to another student for review. This peer review process is central to our platform, fostering a collaborative learning environment. What sets our product apart is our commitment to enhancing the quality of peer reviews. Before a reviewer receives an assignment, it is processed through a Large Language Model (LLM). This advanced AI technology thoroughly examines the submitted code, identifying areas for potential improvement. It then provides the reviewer with insightful hints and guidance on what to look for during their review. This not only helps reviewers provide more constructive feedback but also aids in their own learning and understanding of the subject matter. By leveraging cutting-edge AI, Pear-to-Peer not only streamlines assignment management but also enriches the educational experience by ensuring that peer reviews are thorough, insightful, and beneficial for all students involved. Our goal is to create a supportive educational ecosystem where both teachers and students can thrive. This project is based on the course Project Software Engineering of UvA. My roleOrganize daily stand-ups and plannings. Implement backend api for Admin page and connection with the database. Features For Teachers Assignment Management: Teachers can easily create, manage, and assign coursework to students. Submission Tracking: Monitor student submissions and track the review process efficiently. For Students Submission Portal: Students can submit their assignments through an intuitive interface. Peer Reviews: After submission, assignments are randomly assigned to other students for review. AI-Powered Review AssistanceWhat sets Pear-to-Peer apart is our integration of a Large Language Model (LLM) to assist in the peer review process: Automated Code Analysis: Before a student reviewer receives an assignment, our LLM analyzes the submitted code to identify potential areas of improvement. Review Guidance: The LLM provides hints and suggestions to the reviewer, helping them focus on critical aspects of the code and enhancing the quality of feedback.

Shannon in the 1950s to investigate the fundamental limits on signal-processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data. These tasks have turned out to be fundamental for all of computer science. In this course, we quickly review the basics of probability theory and introduce concepts such as (conditional) Shannon entropy, mutual information and entropy diagrams. Then, we prove Shannon’s theorems about data compression and channel coding. An interesting connection with graph theory is made in the setting of zero-error information theory. We also cover some aspects of information-theoretic security such as perfectly secure encryption, and draw some connections to machine learning.

Measure with bit, entropy, machine learning Information is often quantified using entropy, that measure the unpredictability or randomness in a data source. The higher the entropy, the more “surprise” or uncertainty there is in the source, which correlates to more information Related: How to ask the most informative questions. How can we compress a data source? Lossless: ZIP, GIF, FLAC. Lossy: JPG, MP3, MP4. Compression leverages patterns and redundancies in data to reduce its size. Lossless methods like Huffman coding and arithmetic coding optimise symbol representation while lossy methods (e.g. JPEG) reduce data fidelity for more significant compression. Shannon’s source coding theorem provides a limit, stating that the minimum average length of encoding for a source cannot be less than its entropy. How can we reliably send information over noisy channels? Reliable communication over noisy channels is addressed through error-correcting codes. Shannon’s noisy-channel coding theorem shows it’s possible to transmit data with an arbitrarily low error rate if the transmission rate is below the channel’s capacity. Codes like Reed-Solomon or Hamming codes detect and correct errors, ensuring data integrity. CompressionCompression is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. The goal is to reduce redundancy in data to save storage space or transmission time, without losing essential information. Lossless Compression: This type of compression allows data to be reconstructed perfectly from the compressed form. Techniques include Huffman coding, Run-Length Encoding, and Lempel-Ziv (LZ) algorithms, as seen in file formats like PNG and ZIP. Lossy Compression: In contrast, lossy compression reduces file size by permanently discarding some information, which results in an approximation of the original data. This is common in multimedia formats like JPEG and MP3, where a perfect reconstruction is unnecessary for human perception.
